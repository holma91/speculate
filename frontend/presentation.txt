PRESENTATION

why?
- decentralized options are currently not that composable
  - compare to nft trading and ERC-20, where it doesn't matter where you trade
  - you can't buy an option on one exchange and sell it on another

- hard to find liquidity, this enables a larger and more free market


how?
- represent derivatives as NFTs

results:
  - interoperability everywhere (other platforms, wallets etc)
  - you can buy the option and exchange x, and then re-sell it on exchange y
  - you can exercise the option anywhere
  - incentivized options selling, by enabling a fee on all subsequent trades



architecture
- two contracts
  - the exchange
    basically a nft marketplace, inspired by LooksRare
  - the option factory
    the contract that handles everything around the options
  - link to the code




VIDEO

--> home

a platform where users can both SELL options, and BUY options

--> view more call options

show what some available call options look like

--> click on specific option that is listed already and have bids

- view the stats, quickly explain european vs american
- look at listing information, explain the limit orders you can make via chainlink price feeds
  - make a limit order on the option

--> go to another option (one that is OTM)
- buy it on the spot
- view on another platform to show the interoperability
- time travel to a day where the option is ITM
  - exercise the option and see the money flowing in


--> go to write options page
- write the option, quickly explain the parameters

we can now go to two different pages
- view the short
- view the long


--> go to the short page
- take a look at the parameters

--> go the long page
- simulate a bot buying the long

--> go to the short page
- view it once again
